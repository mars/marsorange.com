<p>Almost two-years ago, I built a modern, standards-based Web site for <strong>Bodhi Yoga</strong>. I just completed <strong>Version 2</strong> of their site at <a href="http://www.BodhiYoga.com/">BodhiYoga.com</a>. CSS-redesign constituted 98% of the perspiration &mdash; except a simple conversion to XHTML Strict, I hardly touched the HTML structure. CSS efficiency in action, baby!</p>
