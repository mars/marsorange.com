<p>In a groove. Feeling the love. Yoga.</p>

<p>Our senses discern variations &amp; differences. Human nature as such is based on sensory discernment. We are programmed from millennia of evo to be <strong>mENtaL</strong>.</p>

<p>Yoga is evo's answer to deprogramming our brain from all that bastardized discernment. Opening, realizing, experiencing our infinite connection, prana, flow, energy, love.</p>

<p>Spread out, take up space, close your eyes, feel gravity, feel your breath, release every thought, BE PRESENT.</p>

<p>Now, do the same thing in <a href="http://www.alanlittle.org/yoga/GurujiNY2000/downdog.html">Adho</a> <a href="http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/491_1.cfm">Mukha</a> <a href="http://www.theyogashop.co.uk/WEB2003/HTML/shivarea5.php">Svanasana</a>.</p>

<p>Oh yeah! I just booked a flight to LA for <a href="http://www.whitetantricyoga.com/">White Tantric</a> on April 10th. Sweetness.</p>
