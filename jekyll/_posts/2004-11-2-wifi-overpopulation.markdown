Sitting at Halcyon [Coffee|Bar] in <a href="http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/downtown/ware_map.htm">downtown Austin</a> this afternoon, I opened <a href="http://www.macstumbler.com/">MacStumbler</a> and this is what popped up:

A whole heap of networks with lots of spectrum overlap. We have only three non-overlapping radio channels with today's WiFi standards [802.11b/g]. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11#Channels_and_international_compatibility">non-overlapping channels</a> are 1, 6 &#38; 11.

I couldn't access any of the immediate business networks due to various errors. These hotspots are choking each other! Craziness.

Meanwhile, the <a href="http://www.weblogsky.com/gallery/wifi_republic/DSCN1878">Republic Square hot spot</a> worked very well, and it was a full block &#38; a half away from my street side table @Halcyon.
