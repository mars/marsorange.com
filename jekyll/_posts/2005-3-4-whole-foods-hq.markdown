The new Whole Foods world headquarters [a.k.a. the <a href="http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/stores/lamar/index.html">Landmark Store</a>] opened practically around the corner from my home & office two days ago. It's been <a href="http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/stores/lamar/sixth+lamar-constr.html" title="Whole Foods' Construction Slideshow">under construction</a> for almost two years.

The place is a landmark of our capitalistic world, with amazing variety & abundance of the best life-sustaining warez our world has to offer.

The crowds are quite frenzied over there right now, especially around lunch time, which was a high traffic time for the old 6th Street store anyway.

Here's Mars' Top Ten List of the New Whole Foods props:

1. <a href="http://www.living-foods.com/articles/cooked.html">raw, living foods</a> mini-restuarant
2. a chocolate fountain
3. micro-roasted bulk coffee (roasted in 5lb batches before your eyes, BZZZZ)
4. expansive roof-top terrace with integrated rain-collection
5. you can drink yerself tipsy while shopping
6. an entire isle dedicated to refillable bottled water, RO [reverse osmosis] & DI [de-ionized]
7. sushi bar!
8. dumb-waiter to get your goods down to the triple-decker, underground parking garage (I have yet to use it. I'm always on <a href="/gallery/saturday_night/Mongoose_ATB_Night">my bike</a>!)
9. free WiFi
10. the sweet Austin atmosphere
