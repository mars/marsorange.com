After months of [weekend-afternoon cafe work](http://www.progresscoffee.com) & late-night development sessions, I'm pleased to present a new web site created for sword/knife designer, bladesmith & goldsmith *Jot Singh Khalsa* of Millis, Massachusetts:

<a href="http://khalsakirpans.com"><img class="feature_photo" src="/archive/khalsakirpans_home.png" height="235" width="504" alt="" title="" /></a>

Visit this new site which features almost 150 [fine handcrafted knives &amp; swords](http://khalsakirpans.com/gallery) created by Jot Singh over the past three decades.

I constructed the site in <em>Ruby on Rails</em>, [that new-skool web development framework](http://rubyonrails.com) that lets web developers gracefully build high-quality, sustainable applications.

The site is hosted at [TextDrive](http://textdrive.com) using lighttpd/FastCGI/Ruby/MySQL.
