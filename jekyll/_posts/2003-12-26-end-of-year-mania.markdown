<p>Everything seems to be happening at once! I'm moving across town to a beautiful little house on Johanna Street (near South 5th). I've got three Web projects <em>begging</em> to be finished. I must complete defensive driving before January 7th. And, I'm visiting my family in Dallas until Sunday, so I can't really start working on anything yet!</p>

<p>It will be a prosperous New Year!</p>

<p>Peace and love to you all ;-*</p>
