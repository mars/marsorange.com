<p>In Austin for 8-years now &#38; I've attended maybe two SXSW events in all. It's time to change that.</p>

<p>Monday is the day... I'll try &#38; find my way into the <a href="http://www.sxsw.com/interactive/panels/index.php?action=detail&#38;con=ia&#38;id=54">HiFi CSS panel</a> without a badge.</p>

<p>Introduce yourself if you see me.</p>

<p>I will be the one wearing <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">orange camo pants</span> [it's too warm for the camo today].</p>
