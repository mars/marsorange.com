<p>So, it's been four months since Solstice, and I just got around to building a new <a href="/photo/ss2003/">gallery</a> of those photos. Enjoy.</p>

<p>To build it, I hacked Photoshop's "WebContactSheet" template system to generate <em>almost valid</em> XHTML. Adobe hardcoded the table row mark-up, making it impossible to build templates <span class="uiinfo">A)</span> without tables and <span class="uiinfo">B)</span> as valid XHTML. Grrrrrr Adobe, grrrrrrrr!</p>
