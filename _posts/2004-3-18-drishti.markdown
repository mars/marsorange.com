<p>The past two classes I've attended, another student approached me afterward, finding beauty in our practice. Their comments resonate deeply with me.</p>

<p>In practice, <a href="http://www.yogajournal.com/wisdom/642_2.cfm">drishti is the key</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We become aware of how our brains only let us see what we want to see&#8212;a projection of our own limited ideas. Often our opinions, prejudices, and habits prevent us from seeing unity.</p>

<p>Drishti is a technique for looking for the Divine everywhere&#8212;and thus for seeing correctly the world around us. Used in this way, drishti becomes a technique for removing the ignorance that obscures this true vision, a technique that allows us to see God in everything.</p>

<p>Release the attachment to mindful perceptions of things. Allow your primary eye-sense to relax. Whole new states of mind grow from such a fuZZy visual world.</p>
