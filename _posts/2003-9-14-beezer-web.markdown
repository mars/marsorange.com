<p>We (<a href="http://www.A3online.com/">A3</a>) just completed first release of the new <a href="http://www.beza.biz/">beza</a> [<em>beh-zuh</em>] Web site to  show &#38; sell the <strong>Money Clamp</strong>, a really sweet device that solves a long-standing cash-carrying quandary.</p>

<p>The site is accessiblity-oriented XHTML with CSS making it stylish. We're still working out validation and cross-browser-kinks. We come a long way, baby!</p>
