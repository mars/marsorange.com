<p>I subscribed to T-Mobile today. After 1.25 years of experiencing AT&#38;T Wireless' <a href="http://www.cio.com/archive/041504/wireless.html">declining customer support</a> and outrageous data charges (roughly $10/MB!!!), I opted for <a href="http://www.t-mobile.com">a budding company</a> with a reasonably-priced, unlimited GPRS data plan.</p>

<p>My old AT&#38;T Wireless number transferred in about 3-hours! <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,56675,00.html">Thank you FCC.</a></p>

<p>So, I called AT&#38;T Customer Support to cancel my service, and I am treated to the service <a href="http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_866530.html?menu=news.scienceanddiscovery">poo</a> that is 50% of why I decided to switch wireless providers: I <strong>waited 31-minutes</strong> to speak with a service representative, who finally came on the line, apparently couldn't hear me, and therefore then <strong>promptly disconnected the line</strong>. I wonder how many other callers he disconnected before he realized that his headset wasn't plugged in completely!</p>

<p>I <strong>will</strong> break up with AT&#38;T. Perhaps tomorrow. I give up for now.</p>
