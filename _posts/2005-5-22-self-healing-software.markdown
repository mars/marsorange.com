Web development, a never-ending story, the evolution of information, practically dropped into my lap by the universe. My preparation for the world of producing information software was void of formal training. Each time I attempted formal training, I felt too limited, and so I always escape.

So now, I am exploring Ruby's unit testing framework (<a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/Test/Unit/Assertions.html" title="Test::Unit::Assertions in the Rails Documentation">extended in Rails</a>).

Never having used a software unit test framework, I see: <em>this beautiful facet of programming which makes software work intrinsically better.</em>

In this process, I've found many references to <a href="http://extremeprogramming.org/rules.html" title="The Rules of Extreme Programming">Extreme Programming</a> [XP]. Part of XP process uses these <a href="http://extremeprogramming.org/rules/testfirst.html">unit tests</a> (small embedded assertions which can be tested automatically) to alter the traditional development process from "code, then test" to "test, then code", making software systems emerge as organic &amp; sustainable <a href="http://extremeprogramming.org/rules/collective.html">collectively owned source code</a>.

I like where this is headed.
