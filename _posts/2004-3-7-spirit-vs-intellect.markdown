<p>Wandering a path of spiritual expansion, I experience many moments of silent awe, echoed with notions of meaninglessness.</p>

<p>Meaningless inasmuch as how does one use this experience improve the world? From spiritual endeavors, one can realize the Truth, but intelligence and perspiration are required to influence the course of humanity (or even a trip to the grocery store).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The psychic and even physical powers possessed by prophets and seers are merely in the nature of manifestation, an emblem of sovereignty bestowed by nature. In the circumstance, the application of the extremely rare spiritual endowments to the solution of day-to-day problems of human physical existence, for which intellect is the proper instrument, would be no less irrational than the utilization of the quality of heaviness in gold for the purpose of crushing stones with it to provide material for roads. The curative and other powers sometimes exercised by mystics and saints never went beyond the sphere of individual application, and it was left for people of genius who brought vision to the aid of intellect to devise universally efficacious remedies for scourges like smallpox and to make other discoveries in the physical realm, a task which was neither accomplished by nor fell within the province of prophets and visionaries.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This is the idea that prophets have been misunderstood throughout history. Such saintly humans represent a distant horizon on a path of human evolution, toward which our present intelligence and perspiration just might serve to deliver us.</p>
